# FolderSizeChecker
use csc to compile. 

This is a basic application that I wrote to check a folder size in cmd to make sure it doesn't get to big as another process runs. 

use csc to compile the .cs file to an exe. If you don't know how to use csc, it is pretty simple. 

Just google C# command line compilier.
